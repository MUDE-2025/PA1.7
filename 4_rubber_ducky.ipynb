    "# Rubber Ducky Debugging\n",

    "If you are having troubles finding out where an error is in your code, you can also turn to 'Rubber Ducky Debugging'. \n",
    "The idea of this is that it forces you to explain, in very simple language and step-by-step, what you want your code to do and what each line of code does. Your rubber ducky does not need to study engineering, they have a very simple life, so they need a very gentle introduction to your code. Often, you will find an error in the code logic while talking through it. This is not to say that your rubber ducky is not smart, they are simply smart in other ways. \n",

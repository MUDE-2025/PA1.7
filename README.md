# Programming Assignment 1.7: BugBuster

*Due: Friday, October 17, 2025.*

You can preview this assignment on https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/workbook-2025/assignments/PA1.7/README.html. This preview doesn't include a preview of the `.py` files. You can obtain your personal repository for submission on: `classroom.github.com/a/<xxxxxxx>`.

Debugging lets you pause execution, inspect variables, and step through your code to find and fix issues faster. In this assignment you'll set up VS Code for Python debugging, practice with a small script, and learn how to debug Jupyter Notebooks.

In this assignment you'll make exercises on:
- [Setting up VS Code for Python debugging](1_setup_debug.md)
- [Debugging a py file](2_debug_py_file.md)
- [Debugging a Jupyter Notebook cell](3_debug_notebook.ipynb)
- [Rubber Ducky Debugging (Optional)](4_rubber_ducky.ipynb) 

You pass this PA if you:
- Debugged `debug_example.py` using breakpoints, stepping commands, exception breakpoints, and conditional breakpoints preventing the `ZeroDivisionError`.

    "This can be ... problematic. There is a known issue with debugging Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code that makes working with it very frustrating from time to time, as described here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/150219\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to debug a Jupyter Notebook cell, click the arrow next to the cell and select \"Debug Cell\": \n",

    "![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/datascience/jupyter/debug-cell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This arrow sometimes disappear. If that happens, click in the toolbar: View - > Command Palette... and type \"Developer: Reload Window\". This will reload the VS Code window and the arrow should appear again. Otherwise, you can click `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Alt` + `Enter` to start debugging a specific cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this all works, you can debug notebooks in the same way as Python files, with breakpoints, stepping, inspecting variables, etc."
